    <p>The server can receive commands from third party applications, like mobile apps.</p>

    <p>
    To send a commands to the server, a TCP stream socket has to be initialized and connected to the raspberry pi host ip.
    The command has to be a string with a maximum size of 1024 bytes.
    By default the server listens to port <strong>4321</strong>, but this can be configured with <strong>configutre.py config</strong> or manually set in <strong>config.py</strong>.
    </p>

    <div id="communication">
        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <p>
            The whole communication in RGB-Pi is based on the exchange of JSON-objects.
            This means every message sent to the RGB-Pi server has to be a valid JSON-object serialized as string.
            After each sent message a JSON-object is sent back as answer and acknowledgement at the same time.
        </p>

            }
        </code></pre>

        <p>In the code snippets above you can see the basic components of a communication session.
            To get more in detail we will show you first the complete sequence of actions happen during a
            communication between client and server and then show some examples for each message-/answer-part.
        </p>

        <h3 id="communication-basic">Basic communication flow</h3>
        <p>The low level actions that take place during communication are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>CONNECT via TCP Socket to the IP:Port of the RGB-Pi server.</li>
            <li>SEND a serialized JSON-object as string in the format described <a href="#communication-client-message">above</a>.</li>
            <li>RECEIVE the answer for the sent request.</li>
            <li>CLOSE the TCP socket.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="communication-answer">Answer</h3>
        <p>
            <p>
            The server processes the incoming client request and sends an answer in JSON-format as response.
            You can see in the <a href="#communication-server-answer">answer-syntax</a> that there are 4 possible nodes in the answer object from the server.
            </p>

            <p>
            The first two are simple to understand: if the client request contained at least one command/filter the answer object will have a corresponding node,
            whose value is <strong>1</strong> if the commands/filters were recognized and correctly initialized, otherwise the commands/filters node has a <strong>0</strong> as value.
            </p>

            <p>
            If the client contained a request node, the answer object will also contain a request node with the answer-content of the requested value/functionality.
            In some cases this isn't only a simple value, but can also be a complex json-object representing the answer to the request (like in the case of some XBMC-requests).
            </p>

            <p>
            The last node in the answer object, 'error', is always present.
            It contains a string array which is emtpy in the best case, otherwise it contains the errors/exceptions happened
            during the interpretation or initialization of the received client request.
            </p>

        </p>

    <div id="commands">
        <h2>Commands</h2>
        <p><strong>Commands</strong> are the core elements of RGB-Pi.</p>
        <p>They need to be on first level of the communication json-object, referenced by the key <strong>'commands'</strong>.
            There must be only one 'commands'-node with a array which contains a 0-n list of commands</p>
        <p>Some commands can also contain an array with sub-commands, in order to make it possible to build every imaginable effect you want.
        More details follow below.</p>

<div id="datatypes">
        <h2>Data types</h2>
        <p>In order to control RGB-Pi in a flexible and dynamic way, we created some complex datatypes.
        These have unlike other communication structures their own format.
        </p>
        <p>Each data type is a string which is enclosed with <strong>{}</strong>-brackets. Currently there a <strong>3</strong>
        different data types that can be used in RGB-Pi messages: Color, Time and Condition
        </p>
        <p>Each data type is described in the following format: <strong>{SUBTYPE:VALUE}</strong>, where SUBTYPE describes how the VALUE is interpreted.
        More details to the data types and the way you declare the are found below.</p>
        <!-- COLOR -->
        <div id="datatype-color">
            <h3>Color</h3>
            <p>Color represents like the name hints a color in RGB format. A color can be defined in multiple ways. </p>
            <p id="datatype-color-syntax">Syntax: <strong>{b|f|x|r:string[:hex-byte]}</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>b</strong> - Byte representation, where the color is described with 3 values between 0-255 for each channel<br/>
                    <strong>Syntax: {b:R,G,B}</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>example: <strong>{b:165,42,42}</strong> - this would create the color brown</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>f</strong> - Float representation, where the color is described with 3 values between 0.0-1.0 for each channel<br/>
                    <strong>Syntax: {f:R,G,B}</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>example: <strong>{f:0.647,0.165,0.165}</strong> - this would create the color brown</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>x</strong> - Hexstring representation, where of the color is described as 6-character-hex string (RRGGBB)<br/>
                    <strong>Syntax: {x:RRGGBB}</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>example: <strong>{x:A52A2A}</strong> - this would create the color brown</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>r</strong> - Random float representation, where the color is described with 3 ranges between 0.0-1.0 for each channel<br/>
                    <strong>Syntax: {r:R1-R2,G1-G2,B1-B2}</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>example: <strong>{r:0.5-1,0-1,0-0}</strong> - random color in half of the red spectrum and the whole green spectrum</li>

                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>All this variations can be applied to one or more specific <strong>addresses</strong> of a led-stripe.</p>
            <p>
            As you see in the description of the <a href="#datatype-color-syntax">color syntax</a>, there is an optional additional <strong>:hex-byte</strong>.<br/>
            This is used to address multiple led stripes with a 8-bit bitmask represented as hexa-decimal digit (e.g. 0x1 to address the first stripe).<br/>
            Here a single address list for each stripe:
            <ol>
            <li>LED-stripe = 0x1</li>
            <li>LED-stripe = 0x2</li>
            <li>LED-stripe = 0x4</li>
            <li>LED-stripe = 0x8</li>
            </ol>
            You can also write <strong>0x3</strong> to address the first two stripes, or <strong>0xF</strong> to address all stripes (this is the default value if no address is specified in the color literal)<br/>
            As you can see, a maximum number of 4 stripes are supported yet.<br/>
            <strong>Syntax: {SUBTYPE:VALUE:ADDRESS}</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>example: <strong>{b:255,0,0:0x1}</strong> - red color on the first LED-stripe</li>
                <li>example: <strong>{r:0-1,0,0:0x5}</strong> - random bright red color on the first and the third LED-stripe</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Note: Addressing is an experimental feature right now, it's only tested with the <a href="#command-cc">CC-command</a> yet.</p>

        <div id="datatype-time">
            <h3>Time</h3>
            <p>The almost self-explained type name hints that this data type stands for a finite amount of time. it can be represented in 2 different ways.</p>

                        <li>example: <strong>10.5</strong> - another, simplier way to describe the same amount of time is to write the value directly (this will be implicitly casted to the format of the first example)</li>
